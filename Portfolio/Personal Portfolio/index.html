<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>I was born in Salt Lake City raised in Boise. I love the outdoors and spend time outside
    as much as I can. I am currently in college at the College of Western Idaho pursuing a degree
    in Software Development. After that I plan to continue my education at 
    BSU and finish my bachelors in software engineering.
    <p>Outside of software, I enjoy fishing, backpacking, skiing, and spending time with
        people I care about.
